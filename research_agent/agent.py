from google.adk.agents import Agent

# Exercise 1: Create a simple research agent
# TODO: Define your root_agent here
#
# Hints:
# - Use the Agent class from google.adk.agents
# - Set a descriptive name, model, instruction, and description
# - The model should be "gemini-2.0-flash" for fast responses
#
# Example structure:
# root_agent = Agent(
#     name="...",
#     model="...",
#     instruction="...",
#     description="...",
# )

root_agent = None  # Replace this with your Agent definition
